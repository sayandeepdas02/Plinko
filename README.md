# 🎯 Plinko (Stake Game)

Plinko is a physics-based **stake game** inspired by the classic Plinko board, where a ball drops through multiple obstacles and lands in a final block determining the result.

This project demonstrates **game logic, physics simulation, and full-stack structure** using modern web technologies.

## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. A ball is released from the top of the Plinko board.
2. The ball interacts with obstacles using physics-based logic.
3. Direction changes are randomized at each collision.
4. The final slot determines the outcome of the game.
5. Backend handles logic validation and processing.
